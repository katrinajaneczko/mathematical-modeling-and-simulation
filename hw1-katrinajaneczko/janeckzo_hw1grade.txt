On Matlab:
-> Whatever you put in the comments right after you declare a function acts as a
short description of your code that can been visualized by calling help with the
name of your function. The feature won't work if you have a comment as the first line
of code.

Problem 1a)
==========================
(+) Very detailed explanation that includes the main idea of a wave arising from
the update rule

Problem 1b)
==========================
(+) Wave arises as an consequence of the update rules
(+) Model description updated

Problem 1c)
==========================
Line 22 could be an initialization with all zeros.
Something to think about is what this model means physically.

(+) Checking of neighbor behavior
(+) There is a visual of a wave of length 5 propagating
(-) Description of model not updated - if sitting and left neighbor standing, stand
if standing and left neighbor sitting, sit


Problem 1d)
===========================
Comment on model description:
-> Not all ABMs have agent-agent interactions.
-> Can the number of standing agents be restored to the original once the wave
has been interrupted by the random action?

(+) Well justified variability included in model.
